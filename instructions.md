I want to build a Chrome Extension called "Crayon Canvas" that will do the following:

- When extension is clicked to open, it will detect if the current browser window has image on the screen. If not, it will output the message that you need to run the extension with only the image is opened
- When the image is present, a button will appear to convert the image to the coloring page, which means that the image should be processed and put to black & white and just do ouutline lines in the image by some techniques
- After this is done, image will download to a computer or user will be prompted where to save the new image

## Technologies

Can we use React for this or do you think for processing images as coloring pages Pyhton would be better?
